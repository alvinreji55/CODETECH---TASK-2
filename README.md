### Overview of the Project:

## Project: Python Programming

### Project: Simple Calculator in Python

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a Simple Calculator using Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations such 
as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator will be able to take user input, process the 
operation, and display the result. This project helps understand fundamental programming concepts such as functions, 
input/output, and conditional logic.


# Key Activities:
# 1. Designing the Calculator: 
#    Create a user-friendly console-based calculator that accepts user input for two numbers and an operation.

# 2. Implementing Functions:
#    Write individual functions for each arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# 3. Error Handling:
#    Implement error handling for scenarios like division by zero and invalid inputs.

# 4. Loop for Continuous Use:
#    Create a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

# 5. User Input Validation:
#    Ensure that inputs are valid numbers and operations.

# Technologies Used:
# 1. Python: The primary programming language used to build the calculator.
# 2. Functions: To modularize the code for each operation.
# 3. Conditional Statements: Used to determine the operation based on user input.
# 4. Exception Handling: To handle errors like division by zero.
